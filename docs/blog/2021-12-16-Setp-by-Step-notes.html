<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>To the person who has taken a derivative and computed an integral at least once in their life, the step by step pedagogical treatment of the examples provides an outline of the workings of our universe from the grandest observational astronomical scales down to the quark-gluon plasmas produced by our most energetic particle accelerators for some time to come. Nature, through galactic, if not intergalactic acceleration processes slams our planet with handfuls of particles having energies upwards of a 100-million times greater than our largest accelerator to date, the Large Hadron Collider capable of producing 14 TeV proton-proton collisions. No new physics has been observed from cosmic ray collisions. Moreover, the Earth has not been sucked into a black hole. In a decade or three, humanity should attain 100 TeV energies in 100 km accelerators, just shy of nature by a factor of a million, and the money, of course.</p>
<p>To graduating math and physics seniors. In step by step fashion, these notes extracted from many sources but organized by the author, are designed to provide graduating seniors in mathematics and physics the framework of foundational physics, namely, the topics of particles and gravitation and unified fields and big bangs in terms of differential forms, manifolds, algebra, geometry, topology, in particular, fiber bundle theory. The last section, treating the Hopf Fibration, is shamelessly excerpted from Wikipedia for explicitly and transparently detailing the development of the first fiber bundles by Heinz Hopf in the early 1930s in his study of higher dimensional spheres (or hyperspheres), thus providing a capstone to all the previous mathematical materials. The penultimate section details the physical motivations (Dirac’s magnetic monopoles) for why differential forms and fiber bundle theory needed to be developed in terms of connections over principle bundles otherwise known as gauge fields by particle and field theorists, or as connections in general relativity. By analogy, gauge fields for particles and fields theories, and connections for general relativity, while impressive, are much like the discoveries of the formulas for quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials through the Dark Ages before the advent of nineteenth century Galois theory. No further efforts needed to be wasted on the search for general, closed form formulas for the roots of quintic or higher order polynomials. Group theory forbids them. Graduate and postgraduate physics students. The intent of these notes is to obviate luck in finding the right books, the right papers, and the right lectures to put all the machinery of foundational physics in one place, logically developed. If one doesn’t know this stuff, then one isn’t a master or a doctor of physics as much as a witch doctor of faith-based prescriptions. I don’t expect pilots to be aerospace engineers, nor aerospace engineers to be pilots, but aerospace engineers better be aerospace engineers, with the same going for medical doctors, brain surgeons, and nuclear weapons designers.</p>
